**🔧 Troubleshooting: Connection & Permission Errors**
If you cannot connect to your database (Errors 10061, 1130, etc.), the issue is usually caused by the configuration of the Linux/MariaDB Server, not the script itself.

**1. Error: 10061 (Connection Refused)**
Symptom: The script cannot reach the server at all. Cause: The MySQL/MariaDB server is configured to listen only on localhost (127.0.0.1). Solution:

Open the configuration file on your Linux server:

MariaDB: sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

MySQL: sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf (or /etc/mysql/my.cnf)

Find the line bind-address = 127.0.0.1.

Change it to: bind-address = 0.0.0.0

Restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart mariadb
# or
sudo systemctl restart mysql
2. Error: 1130 (Host '...' is not allowed to connect)
Symptom: The network connection works, but the server rejects the user. Cause: The database user (e.g., root) is restricted to local connections only. Solution:

Log in to the database locally on your server:

sudo mariadb -u root -p
Allow remote access for your user (replace YourPassword):

**SQL**

-- Allow root access from ANY IP address (%)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Note: For better security, consider creating a dedicated backup user instead of using root remotely.

**3. Firewall (UFW)**
If you still cannot connect, ensure port 3306 is open:

sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp
sudo ufw reload
